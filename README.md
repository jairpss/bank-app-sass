## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
By [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

**To do this challenge, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Thanks for watching!! ðŸ˜‰
